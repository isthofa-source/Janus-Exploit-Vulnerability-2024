# Janus-Exploit-Vulnerability-2024
Hello guys, here I only updated the version for the Janus Vulnerability exploit from before because the previous version was out of date from [VEOâ€™s repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-E-O/PoC/master/CVE-2017-13156/janus.py).

# Description
## Differences with previous exploit codes
### Using Byte Literal
The difference with Python 3, we can't use a string directly in a byte comparator like you did with '\x50\x4b\x05\x06'.
We need to convert the string into byte form using the .encode() method or use a direct byte literal. Here are some improvements we can make to the previous exploit code
```python
cd_end_addr = apk_data.rfind(b'\x50\x4b\x05\x06')
pos = apk_data.find(b'\x50\x4b\x01\x02', pos+46, cd_end_addr)
```
### buffer() > memoryview
The buffer() function no longer exists in Python 3, we can use the memoryview object to get the same result. Here are the changes for that part:
```python
v = adler32(memoryview(data[12:])) & 0xffffffff
```
## Import Libraries:
This script uses several Python modules, namely sys to access command line arguments, struct to help pack and unpack binary data, hashlib to calculate SHA-1 hashes, and adler32 to calculate Adler-32 values.
## Update_checksum function (def update_checksum(data)):
This function calculates the checksum and SHA-1 hash for specific data in an APK file. It then updates the checksum and hash values in the APK header.
## main function (def main()):
The main function does the following:
- Checks the number of command line arguments. If they do not match, prints a usage message and exits.
- Reads the DEX and APK files into the variables dex_data and apk_data.
- Identifies the location in the APK that contains information about the file list (CD End).
- Updates the information in the APK to add the DEX file.
- Writes the modified data into a new file.
- Prints a message that a new APK file has been created.
## Function Execution main:
This line executes the main function when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

In general, this script serves to modify APK files by adding DEX files to them and performing some updates regarding the information inside the APK. Please note that direct manipulation of the APK file like this may cause the APK to become invalid or non-compliant with legitimate distribution policies. Make sure you understand the consequences of this action.
